Pair this entrée with a simple rice pilaf: Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.
Add 1/2 cup chopped onion and 2 
teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger 
to pan; sauté 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup water, 
1/2 cup long-grain rice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt; 
bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat,
 and simmer 12 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. 
Remove from heat; stir in 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro.
